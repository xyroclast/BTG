I've been trying for ages to find a truly great, free alternative to Photoshop. I find GIMP
frustrating in several ways, especially the Mac version, which has the additional frustration
of needing to be run in X11.
So, this project will most likely be in Objective C (subject to change).
The plan, then, is to start this off as a Mac project, and port it to other systems if it
comes to fruition/catches on/is any good.
I don't necessarily have time to work on it right now, but I figured, hey, I might as well
start the project in case anyone would like to get a head start on working on this.
Everyone is welcome.
Have fun!
