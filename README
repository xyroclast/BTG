I've been trying for ages to find a truly great, free alternative to Photoshop.
I find GIMP frustrating in several ways, especially the Mac version, which has the additional frustration of needing to be run in X11.
I think that Java is the logical choice for the project, due to its no-fuss "just works" cross-platform nature.
I don't necessarily have time to work on it right now, but I figured, hey, I might as well start the project in case anyone would like to get a head start on working on this.
Everyone is welcome.
Have fun!

Implementation: This is a Java project created in Eclipse.
